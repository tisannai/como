# Como

Como library provides low manifest command line option parsing and
deployment. The command line options are described in compact table
format and option values are stored to conveniently named
properties. Como builds command usage information based on the option
table (+ generic program info) and displays it automatically if
necessary. Como supports also subcommands.


# Building

Como is build using autotools flow. Run "autogen.sh" to get all basic
files setup.


# Documentation

The source code is documented in Doxygen format. Documentation can be
generated with:

page).


# Examples
